Job Hunter is an app designed for finding and listing jobs. Users have the ability to be either a job seeker or employer. 
Employers have the following abilities: they can post as many job listings as they'd like, including job information and 
requirements. When an applicant applies, employers can view their profiles and download their resumes. Furthermore, 
employers can mark the application status to indicate their interest.

Job seekers, on the other hand, have the ability to view and apply to as many jobs as they'd like. On the job exploration 
page, they can also see the jobs they've applied to and their application status. Job seekers can create their own profile, 
providing personal and important information about themselves. They also have a section to add their experiences. When 
applying for a job, their profile is automatically sent to the employer, and seekers can also attach their resumes.

This application was built using Java and Bootstrap. Some of the main challenges in creating this application were 
implementing experiences for job seekers, enabling the download of resumes for employers, making job seekers' profiles 
visible to employers, and ensuring that applicants show up when an employer checks a job listing.

Breakdown of how the app functions:

EMPLOYERS:
- On the landing page, employers can either check their job listings or add a new job.
- When adding a job, they have the option to include the company's name, job title, job description, location, salary, 
  education, experience level, and job type. The posted date is automatically added when creating a job.
- When viewing their job listings, employers can choose to either view or edit the listing.
- When an employer views a job, they can see all the applicants who have applied. From there, they are able to view 
  the applicant's profile and experiences. Additionally, they can download the applicant's resume. Employers can also 
  update the status of the application.

JOB SEEKERS:
- On the landing page, seekers can navigate to their profile or view all jobs.
- On their profile page, they can enter all their personal information for employers to see and contact them.
- Seekers also have a separate section to add their past experiences. Furthermore, they can delete or edit their 
  experiences if desired.
- When viewing all jobs, seekers are presented with all available jobs to choose from. If they have applied to a job, they 
  can see the application status on the home screen.
- When viewing a listing, seekers can see all the information about the job and apply for it. They can add a cover letter 
  and attach their resume when applying.
